# 4. Chapter - Linear Algebra

Branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces

## Vectors

- We can only operate on vectors of same lenght (so far)
- `from functools import reduce` -> will run a function for each + next and return the value like, `reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 3, 4])`

## Matrices

Are two-dimensional collection of numbers

- If a matrix has n rows and k columens, we will refer it as an `n x k matrix`
- We also refer it as vector of length k where each column as vector of lenth n

# 5. Chapter - Statistics

math and techniques with which we understand data

- `histogram` -> a special bar graph or chart that demonstrates how often something occurs.
- `distil` -> purify.

## Central Tendencies

- `mode` -> most-common values
- `percentile` -> it is a point below which a specific proportion of the data falls
- `median` -> middle most if even or avg of the 2 middle most
- `mean` -> halway between then `sum(x) / len(x)`
